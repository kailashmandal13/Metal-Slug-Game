## Overview

**Metal Slug 6** is a classic run-and-gun platform game developed as part of the COP701 course at IIT Delhi. In this project, we recreate the action, challenging gameplay, and feel of Metal Slug using **Unity3D**.

The game features smooth graphics, progressive 3 levels, and dynamic gameplay. Players fight through various themed levels filled with enemies, traps, and boss battles while collecting power-ups and upgrading their weapons.
